I'm Alex, and I work for Honeywell Aerospace as an Automation Engineer. My team designs, builds and maintains test hardware and software for the manufacturing tests of accelerometers.

I also have a side business, Oswald Technologies, LLC that provides [TireDispatcher](https://tiredispatcher.com) for commercial tire companies to keep track of their mobile services.
