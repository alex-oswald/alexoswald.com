### My own blog

I've always wanted to create my own blog to share my solutions to different coding problems I've solved over the years. I've finally gotten around to creating one. And I did it with my favorite tools! __Here is my adventure...__


#### My requirements

- Use Azure DevOps for version control and CI/CD
- Use Azure storage's static website feature
- Static site generator
- Custom domain
