I've always wanted to create my own blog to share my solutions to different coding problems I've experienced over the years. I've finally made time to create one, so here is how I did it.

I started with a few requirements:

- Static site generator - I wanted to use a static site generator for its simplicity and speed benefits.
- Custom domain - Use the domain I purchased: `alexoswald.com`
- Fast & secure - It needs to be fast & secure. Consistent load times under 750-1000ms would be nice.
- Cheap, less than $50 per year - The domain is $20 a year from GoDaddy with privacy. That leaves $30 for hosting and security.

I am a Microsoft fan and .NET fanatic so I will most always utilize their tools.
Another few requirements regarding personal preferences:

- Azure DevOps for version control
- Azure Pipelines for builds and release deployments
- Deployed in Azure

In this guide, we will setup Azure to host a blog via Azure CDN. We will use Jekyll to generate our static site. Since we don't want to deal with installing Ruby or Jekyll, we will develop the site in VSCode using dev containers. With dev containers, we can develop inside a container that already has Ruby and Jekyll installed.


---


## Prerequisites

- Azure subscription

- Azure DevOps

- A custom domain

- Visual Studio Code with the [Remote - Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension

- Docker Desktop


---


## Create a resource group in Azure

Create a resource group in Azure that will hold all of the blogs resources. In this instance, I'm naming the resource group `BlogResourceGroup`. #variables-resourceGroup

---


## Setup storage account in Azure

**Create** a storage account in Azure

![create-storage-account](/assets/images/2020-10-25/create-storage-account.png)

In the storage account, go to **Static website**. Set the `Static website`
option to `Enabled`.

Set **Index document name** to `index.html` (generated by Jekyll).

Set **Error document path** to `404.html` (generated by Jekyll).

**Save** the change.

![storage-static-website](/assets/images/2020-10-25/storage-static-website.png)

The `Primary endpoint` will be used in the next step.

Visit **Settings** > **Access keys**.

**key1** will be used in the Azure pipeline to access the storage account. #variables-key

### Create Azure CDN endpoint

While viewing the storage account resource, under **Blob service**, go to **Azure CDN**.

From here, we are going to create a new `Endpoint`.

For **CDN profile**, select **Create new**, with the name of your choosing. #variables-cdnProfile

Set the **Pricing tier** to **Premium Verizon** so we can set HTTP rules later.

Set the **Origin hostname** to the static website `Primary endpoint` from above.

Enter the **CDN endpoint name**. #variables-endpointName

Click **Create**.

![create-azure-cdn-endpoint](/assets/images/2020-10-25/create-azure-cdn-endpoint.png)

Navigate to the newely created resource.

Navigate to **Settings** > **Origin** and deselect **HTTP**. We only want to allow HTTPS.

![endpoint-disable-http](/assets/images/2020-10-25/endpoint-disable-http.png)


---


## Create project in Azure DevOps

Login to your DevOps account: [https://dev.azure.com/](https://dev.azure.com/)

Add a new project, making sure *Version control* is set to **Git**.

Navigate to **Repos** > **Files**.

Now we are going to **Clone in VS Code** for next steps.


---


## Use Jekyll to generate the site inside a Dev Container

[Check out Microsoft's dev containers tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers-tutorial)

We have an empty repo now open in VS Code. To get started, lets get our dev container running. To do this,
open the `Command Palette` and run the task `Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container`.

![open-folder-dev-container](/assets/images/2020-10-25/open-folder-dev-container.png)

Select your repo folder. Once you do this, VS Code will ask you to choose the correct configuration files.

We will select `Jeykll`.

![jekyll-dev-container-template](/assets/images/2020-10-25/jekyll-dev-container-template.png)

This will automatically create the dev containers config file, Dockerfile, and VS Code tasks for Jekyll.

I've made a few small modifications to the configuration files.

In the dev container Dockerfile lets uncomment the section to update and install other packages. I'd like to install git as well.

```Dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && export DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive \
    && apt-get -y install git
```

We also want the bundler to install packages after the dev container is created. To do this, open `devcontainer.json` and uncomment the line `"postCreateCommand": "bundle install",`.

If you don't already have the proper `.gitignore` file in your project directory, create one with the following contents (this file was generated for me by Azure Devops):

```
_site
.sass-cache
.jekyll-cache
.jekyll-metadata
```

Your development environment is now running in a container so lets get down to business and create our Jekyll site.

Open a terminal window. Since our dev environment is running in a container with Linux, we are presented with a bash terminal.

Create a new Jekyll site in the current folder.

```powershell
jekyll new ./
```

Jekyll will create the site, and a `Gemfile`. Then it will run `bundle install` to install the gems specified in the `Gemfile`.

Your projects file structure should now be similar to the following. Items in green were created by Jekyll.

![jekyll-new-file-structure](/assets/images/2020-10-25/jekyll-new-file-structure.png)

Now we are going to build and run the site to check it out. We can manually execute the commands, or use one of the two VS Code tasks that were created for us in `tasks.json`. Lets run the `Serve` task. Open the `Command Palette` and
search/click `Tasks: Run Task`, then click `Serve`.

After your site is built, navigate to [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/) in a browser.

VoilÃ , we now have a generated static website!


---


## Create a build pipeline

We are going to create a build pipeline in Azure DevOps so the site is built each time a push is made to the master or a tag is created. The built site is stored as an Artifact and can be used in other pipelines.

Navigate to **Pipelines** > **Pipelines** and click **Create Pipeline**.

You will be asked where your code is. Select **Azure Repos Git**.

Then select your repository.

Choose the **Starter pipeline**. Now replace its contents with this yaml: [Azure pipelines yaml](#azure-pipelines-yaml)

Click **Save and run**, specify commit message and options, then click **Save and run** again.


---


## Create a Release Pipeline

Our site is built and stored in DevOps as an Artifact, waiting to be deployed. We will create a release pipeline
that will deploy our site to Azure.

Navigate to **Pipelines** > **Releases** and click **New pipeline**.

Select **Empty job**

![create-release-pipeline2](/assets/images/2020-10-25/create-release-pipeline2.png)

Click **X** to close the Stage pane.

Click **Add an artifact**.

Choose *Build*, select your *Project*, then select the build pipeline we created previously as the *Source*. Click **Add**.

![create-release-pipeline4](/assets/images/2020-10-25/create-release-pipeline4.png)

We have now added the artifact so it can be used by the pipeline.

Under *Stage 1*, click **1 job, 0 task**.

![create-release-pipeline5](/assets/images/2020-10-25/create-release-pipeline5.png)

### Add tasks

We have two new tasks to add.

1. The first task is to Sync the files in the Artifact with your static website container in the Azure Storage account specified. Click the **+** to add a new task.

![create-release-pipeline6](/assets/images/2020-10-25/create-release-pipeline6.png)

Add an `Azure CLI` task.

![create-release-pipeline7](/assets/images/2020-10-25/create-release-pipeline7.png)

 Configure the task:
 - Update **Display name** to **Sync files**
 - Set **Azure Resource Manager connection**
 - Set **Script Type** to **Batch**
 - Set **Script Location** to **Inline script**.
 - Set the **Inline Script** to the following:

```powershell
az storage blob sync --source $(source) --container $(containerName) --account-name $(storageAccount) --auth-mode key --account-key $(key)
```

![create-release-pipeline8](/assets/images/2020-10-25/create-release-pipeline8.png)

3. The second task is to Purge the CDN of all cached files so the new site is pulled and cached.

Add another `Azure CLI` task.

 Configure the task:
 - Update **Display name** to **Purge CDN**
 - Set **Azure Resource Manager connection**
 - Set **Script Type** to **Batch**
 - Set **Script Location** to **Inline script**.
 - Set the **Inline Script** to the following:

```powershell
az cdn endpoint purge --profile-name $(cdnProfile) --content-paths /* --name $(endpointName) --resource-group $(resourceGroup)
```

### Add variables

Both of our tasks use multiple variables we need to define. While still editing Release, click **Variables**.

Add the following variables:

**Sync files**

*source*: Folder name in the artifact that contains the site, `_site` for Jekyll

*containerName*:  $web (set by Azure)

*storageAccount*:  The name of your storage account

[*key*](#variables-key): Access key to your storage account

**Purge CDN**

[*cdnProfile*](#variables-cdnProfile): The name of the CDN Profile used by the Endpoint resource

[*endpointName*](#variables-endpointName): The name of the Endpoint

[*resourceGroup*](#variables-resourceGroup): The name of the Resource Group that contains the Endpoint

![create-release-pipeline10](/assets/images/2020-10-25/create-release-pipeline10.png)

**Make sure to Save your pipeline**

### Create a release

In the top right next to the Save button you just clicked, click **Create release**, after the dialog shows, click **Create**.

This process may take a few minutes. Once complete, open a browser and navigate to the storage accounts `Primary endpoint` you wrote down previously. You can also access the site via the CDN endpoint we created. The site will be `https://endpointname.azureedge.net`.

## Your site should now be deployed!

## Configure Azure CDN to enforce HTTPS & setup custom domains

Now we want to utilize Azure CDN to cache the static site so it is fast & secure for viewers.

>**IMPORTANT**  
>I was able to get my apex domain added as a custom domain to my Azure CDN endpoint, but Azure no longer supports using their free SSL certificates for apex domains. I can't purchase one because it would blow my yearly budget. The option I came up with involves setting up Azure CDN using the `www` subdomain and then forwarding requests to the apex domain to the www subdomain. While I personally dislike having to use the `www` subdomain at all, it is providing me a free SSL certificate.

![azure-cdn-apex-https-fail](/assets/images/2020-10-25/azure-cdn-apex-https-fail.png)



### Add DNS records to domain

In order to setup our custom domains Azure needs to verify you own the domain so we need to setup some CNAME records that Azure can verify.

Add a CNAME with **Host** `www` and **Value** `myblog-endpoint.azureedge.net`.

I'm using GoDaddy for my domains.

![cname-records](/assets/images/2020-10-25/cname-records.png)

### Add custom domain to the CDN endpoint

Navigate to the Azure CDN Endpoint resource.

Navigate to **Settings** > **Custom domains** > **+ Custom domain**

![add-custom-domain-to-endpoint](/assets/images/2020-10-25/add-custom-domain-to-endpoint.png)

Fill in your `www` subdomain. If Azure is able to verify your CNAME record you will see the green check, otherwise there will be a red X.

![add-a-custom-domain](/assets/images/2020-10-25/add-a-custom-domain.png)

Now we need to enable HTTPS for the hostname.

Click your custom domain.

![endpoint-custom-domains](/assets/images/2020-10-25/endpoint-custom-domains.png)

Set **Custom domain HTTPS** to **On**.

I am using Azure's free certificates so I set **Certificate management type** to **CDN managed**.

Then click **Save**.

![enable-custom-domain-https](/assets/images/2020-10-25/enable-custom-domain-https.png)

In my experience, the certificate deployment process can take a few hours to complete.

Once complete, the screen should look like the below.



![https-successfully-enabled](/assets/images/2020-10-25/https-successfully-enabled.png)


### Complete custom domain setup

## Setup special HTTP rules for the CDN endpoint

Change text to lowercase.

![Screenshot](/assets/images/2020-10-25/change-to-lowercase.png)


HSTS Header

![Screenshot](/assets/images/2020-10-25/hsts-header.png)

HTTP to HTTPS Redirect

![Screenshot](/assets/images/2020-10-25/http-to-https-redirect.png)

Redirect Root to WWW

**DID NOT WORK FOR ME**

This wasn't working for me. I had to use GoDaddy to forward the domain to the www subdomain, which was mapped to the Azure CDN endpoint.
